  <i>Curating the best open reasoning datasets</i><br> 
  A collaboration led by <a href="https://bespokelabs.ai/">Bespoke Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.datacomp.ai/">DataComp</a> community

</p>
<hr>

Our first goal is to curate a reasoning dataset to train state-of-the-art small reasoning models that surpass [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

To mitigate variance in evaluation accuracy, we compute average scores over multiple evaluation runs with different seeds. We average over 5 runs for AIME and AMC, and 3 runs for the other tasks. No system prompt is used, the maximum token length is set to 32,768, and temperature is 0.7.

We are fully open-source. Our [model weights](https://huggingface.co/open-thoughts), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/open-thoughts), [data generation code](https://github.com/open-thoughts/open-thoughts), [evaluation code](https://github.com/mlfoundations/Evalchemy), and [training code](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) are all publicly available.

# OpenThoughts2-1M Data Generation
The [OpenThoughts2-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts2-1M) dataset is a combination of [OpenThoughts-114k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts-114k), [OpenR1-Math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-r1/OpenR1-Math-Raw), and our newly generated math and code reasoning data. We generate the additional math and code data by ablating on 26 different question generation methodologies and sampling from the highest performing ones.

The recipe is outlined below:

# OpenThoughts-114k Data Generation

For OpenThoughts-114k, we generate data for the following domains:
1. Code
2. Math
3. Science
4. Puzzle
